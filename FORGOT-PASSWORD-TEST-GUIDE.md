# üîê Forgot Password Flow - Test Guide

## ‚úÖ ISSUE FIXED!

**Problem**: Reset link from email was redirecting to dashboard instead of password reset form.
**Solution**: Modified routing in `App.tsx` to allow `/reset-password` access regardless of authentication status.

## Complete Flow Overview

The forgot password functionality now works as a complete 3-step process:

### Step 1: Request Password Reset
1. Navigate to the login page: `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Click **"Forgot password?"** link
3. Enter your email address
4. Click **"Send Reset Link"**
5. Check your email inbox for the reset link

### Step 2: Reset Password
1. Click the reset link in your email
2. You'll be redirected to: `http://localhost:3000/reset-password`
3. The page should load with a **"Reset Your Password"** form
4. Enter your new password
5. Confirm your new password
6. Click **"Update Password"**
7. You'll see a success message
8. After 3 seconds, you'll be automatically redirected to the login page

### Step 3: Login with New Password
1. On the login page, enter your email
2. Enter your NEW password
3. Click **"Sign In"**
4. You should be successfully logged in and redirected to your dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### If reset link redirects to dashboard instead of password form:
- **This was the main issue and is now FIXED** ‚úÖ
- **What was happening**: App was detecting the session and redirecting authenticated users to dashboard
- **What we fixed**: Made `/reset-password` route accessible regardless of authentication status

### If you see "Reset Link Issue" error:
- **Check your email**: Make sure you clicked the complete link from the email
- **Check timing**: Reset links may expire after some time
- **Try again**: Request a new reset link from the forgot password page

### If the form doesn't load:
- **Check console**: Open browser dev tools and check for any errors
- **Check URL**: Make sure the URL contains authentication tokens after the `#`
- **Clear cache**: Try refreshing or clearing browser cache

### If password update fails:
- **Check password**: Make sure it's at least 6 characters long
- **Check match**: Ensure password and confirm password match exactly
- **Try again**: If it fails, try the complete flow again

## Technical Details

The reset password flow uses:
- **Supabase Auth**: For secure token handling
- **URL Fragments**: Tokens are passed in URL hash for security
- **Session Management**: Temporary session for password update
- **Auto Redirect**: Smooth user experience with automatic navigation

## Security Features

- ‚úÖ Reset links expire automatically
- ‚úÖ Tokens are cleaned from URL after processing
- ‚úÖ Secure token validation
- ‚úÖ Password strength requirements
- ‚úÖ No password exposure in logs

## For Developers

### Key Files Modified:
- `src/pages/auth/ResetPasswordPage.tsx` - New password reset page
- `src/types/auth.ts` - Added NewPasswordFormData interface
- `src/App.tsx` - **CRITICAL FIX**: Made `/reset-password` route accessible regardless of auth status
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Added updatePassword method

### The Critical Fix in App.tsx:
```jsx
// BEFORE (BROKEN): Reset password was only accessible when !user
{!user ? (
  <>
    <Route path="/reset-password" element={<ResetPasswordPage />} />
  </>
) : (
  // User redirected to dashboard
)}

// AFTER (FIXED): Reset password always accessible
<Route path="/reset-password" element={<ResetPasswordPage />} />
{!user ? (
  // Other public routes
) : (
  // Protected routes, but reset-password handled separately
)}
```
