// Clean up the URL after a short delay
setTimeout(() => URL.revokeObjectURL(fileUrl), 1000);
```

// Use the stored file URL from the database
if (note.file_url) {
  window.open(note.file_url, "_blank");
}

// Download with tracking
await incrementTutorNoteDownloadCount(note.id);
const link = document.createElement("a");
link.href = note.file_url;
link.download = note.file_name || "download";
document.body.appendChild(link);
link.click();
document.body.removeChild(link);
```

## Troubleshooting

### File Won't Open

4. **Check permissions**: Ensure file access permissions

### File Opens But Doesn't Display

2. **Word documents**: May download instead of opening
3. **Large files**: May take time to load

### Performance Issues

1. **Large files**: Consider file size limits
